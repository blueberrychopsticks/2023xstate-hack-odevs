# NoIssue

---

## Introduction

- Many of us proud developers, make very little money ;) so we can not afford two monitors! This causes tons of problems, such as not being able to track your Github Repo while working on your React App. Introducing, NoIssue this front-end component allows you to view all issues in every repo you have access too(given a key), as well as the ability to add labels and comments to each individual github issue, all through your front-end web app while you are developing!

#### Components
